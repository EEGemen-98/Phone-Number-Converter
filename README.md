# Phone-Number-Converter
This was a fun challenge problem I did in college while learning C++. The task was to build a program that takes in a phone number input from command prompt, and writes every possible string of letters into a new text file. The letters associations are from a common phone's keypad that has "ABC" on the 2 button, "DEF" on the 3 button, etc. This program lists every possible combination of letters with respect to the given number. The goal of this challenge was just to have a working solution, no contest for efficiency in terms of runtime or memory.

**DISCLAIMER:** The example txt files are not real phone numbers, just randomly chosen pairs of numbers by me. No license.
